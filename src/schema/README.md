# Schema for an example vulnerablity format

An example of the schema in action can be found in the template.json file

An easy schema validator can be isntalled with pip
`pip install jsonschema`

Then run it as such

```
$ jsonschema -i template.json vulnerability.schema.json
$
```

Will mean everything is OK.

If there is a problem you will see something like this

```
$jsonschema -i template.json vulnerability.schema.json
{'severity': 'Low', 'cvss': {'vector': 'vector', 'score': '7'}, 'cqe': 'cwe'}: 'cwe' is a required property
```

The template.json file is skeleton json content that is defined by the
schema.
